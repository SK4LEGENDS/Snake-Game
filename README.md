⚙️ How It Works
🐍 Snake Representation
The snake is an array of coordinates (x, y) representing its body segments.

On each game tick, the snake moves by adding a new head in the current direction and removing the tail unless it eats food.

🍎 Food Mechanics
Food appears randomly on the canvas grid, avoiding the snake’s current position.

When the snake’s head reaches the food, the snake grows longer, and the score increments.

🕹️ Controls and Game Flow
Arrow keys change the snake’s direction, but no 180° turns allowed.

The game updates every fixed interval (game loop).

If the snake collides with itself or the canvas border, the game ends.

The pause button or spacebar toggles pause/resume.

The start button resets the game state.
